My name is Ryan Zhang.<br>

I graduated UCI with a CS degree in 2018 and I am currently working as a full-stack web developer.
I'd like to call myself a software engineer because I understand what's going on "behind the scene" and thus know how to improve and optimize things, sometimes.

I am enthusiastic about coding. One of the reason is that you can build exciting things with just a computer. (A laptop makes it even more magical.) It is kinda like singing. You can make different noises with just your voice. You get what I mean. It's such an elegant way to create things!

I believe in Minimalism. I try to make my life simpler so I can focus on things I truly enjoy doing. Minimalism is a good practice for programming too because most of the time more code leads to more bugs.
