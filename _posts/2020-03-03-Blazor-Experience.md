I have been developing a project at work with Blazor lately.

Although it has been out there for quite a while, I think there aren't many people familiar with it. Neither do I!

'''So what is Blazor?'''
To me it's just another tool to build apps.

'''Blazor VS Razor'''

I am talking about Server-Side Blazor here. Google if your are interested in Client-Side Blazor. 

To oversimplify it, you can think of Razor page as PHP since htmls are generated in server and then sent to browser.

Blazor is a lot like React because it runs on your browser.It just means you can do crazy things without talking to server. Normally it's very hard to accomplish these things with pure html and javascript. For example: state management.

You can update info on your page built with Blazor without refreshing the whole webpage.

Template engines like Razor pages and Django templates are good for dynamically generating webpage.

But Blazor and React makes updating a small piece (e.g. a counter) of info on your page more elegant and interesting. Interactions within your website becomes smooth with the help of them.

'''Who should learn Blazor'''
- Prerequsites are C# and .net core framework.
- Definetely not somebody who is new to coding or web developing.
- You need to be super patient if you are teaching yourself
- Your boss wants you to
- You hate Javascript and want to build frontend with c# and HTML

To be Continued.
