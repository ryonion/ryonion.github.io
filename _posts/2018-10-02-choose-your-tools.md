Nowadays, there are tons of languages and softwares for beginners to choose when they try to build something. Choosing the right tools to begin can mean saving many hours and giving you motivation to finish whatever you attempt to do. 

**I will only talk about what I know of.**

* * *
## Game Development:

Unity: whether you are just making games for fun or looking for jobs in game industry, it is the game engine you wanna begin with.

I have never used it but I have done my little research...

## Web Development:
- If you know nothing -> you may want to start from html, css, and javascript.
You don't need to be an expert, just try to build something interesting with what you learn.

- If you know a little bit html, css, javascript and want to build something with a database (i.e. a CRUD app), try PHP.

###### below are not for beginners

- If you know what a little bit html, css, javascript and know how front-end interacts with back-end (by this I mean "html-javascript <-> your server app"), go for node.js, you can consider frameworks like expressjs for your nodejs apps. 

- if you are confident with your javascript skills -> use reactjs or angularjs for your front-end.

- you want to be a full-stack web developer -> more react/react native/angular

- If you know Python -> Flask/Django.

- If you know Ruby -> Ruby on rails

- If you know Java -> Spring MVC (appears on job posts a lot).

* * *
## a Programming Language to begin with:
- I would say Python, you don't need to know much about low level stuff with Python, the syntax is beginner-friendly.
- To become a computer scientist, c/c++, java.
- one for all, cross-platform: Java

* * *
## Database (DBMS actually)
PostgreSQL/MySQL/Redis/MongoDB

* * *
## Machine Learning
- why not python?
