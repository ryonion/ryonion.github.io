Problem: the fan started making a abnormally big noise when I started to upgrade to High sierra.

I read tons of posts and tried everything I could but did not solve it.

Things that I tried:

- SMC reset
- use fan management apps (they shows the rpn of the fan, and adjusts the rpn)
- downgrade to the previous os (I can’t and I don’t want to, I am grad I did not.)
- kill the apps that use a lot of memory (check activity monitor)

My suggestion will be trying solution 4 first, then 1.

if 4 and 1 don’t work, download an fan management app, check the rpn, if it is around 2000 and it is still making noise, I am pretty sure you have a malfunctioning fan, you can either send it to apple store or replace the fan yourself.

I did not believe it was the fan at first, I took apart the fan and found a minor scratch on the coating of the inner side of the
fan protector”, it was the reason why the fan is making noise even when it is spinning slowly,  now I understand that changes can happen in a surprisingly short time, the fan was working correctly before I upgraded to the new os!!! it must be the os!!!! well…. it wasn”t.

Great experience! hope it helps.
