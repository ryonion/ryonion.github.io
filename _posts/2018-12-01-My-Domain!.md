I bought this domain 6 months ago, and now I am finally using it for my projects!

Ladies and Gentlemen ----------------------

[www.oset.info, it brings you back to my blog](http://www.oset.info/){:target="_blank"}

"oset" is short for "oshiete" it means "tell me/teach me" in Japanese.

Yes it was meant to be used for educational-purpose websites which I plan to build.

For now I am using it for my professors review page - [http://prof.oset.info/rmp_uci/](http://prof.oset.info/rmp_uci/){:target="_blank"}.

Have a nice day, visitor(s)!:notes:
